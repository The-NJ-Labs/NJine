# Contributing to NJine IDE

Thank you for your interest in the "By Python, For Python(maybe more than that!)" IDE! To maintain the project's integrity and protect against hostile forks, please follow these guidelines.

## ⚖️ Legal & Licensing
By contributing to this project, you agree to the following:
1. Your contributions will be licensed under the **GNU AGPL v3**.
2. You certify that you authored 100% of the content and have the right to contribute it.
3. You acknowledge that if you use this code in a network-based service, you must provide the source code to your users.

## 🎯 Our Focus
We are building a highly specialized, terminal-native IDE for Python developers. We do **not** accept:
- Features that require non-Python dependencies (Go, Rust, etc.).
- Bloated GUI elements.
- Changes that break the core "Pure Python" philosophy.

## 🛠 How to Contribute
1. **Open an Issue first:** Do not send a Pull Request (PR) without discussing it. We want to ensure your work fits our roadmap.
2. **Follow the Style:** We use the `Textual` framework. Ensure your UI code matches the Harlequin-inspired theme.
3. **Small PRs only:** We reject massive "re-writes." Keep your changes focused.

## 🚫 Hostile Forks
While AGPL v3 allows forking, we encourage contributors to work *with* us. Improvements made to this tool must remain open. We actively monitor for license compliance.
